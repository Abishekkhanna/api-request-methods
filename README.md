# API Request Methods

A simple repository demonstrating different HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) in a minimal front-end setup using HTML and JavaScript.

## 📂 Repository Structure

/ ├── index.html       ← Main HTML file demonstrating API methods 
  └── script.js        ← JavaScript implementing API request logic

## ✅ What’s Included

- `index.html`: A UI that triggers different HTTP request methods.
- `script.js`: Contains code to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using the Fetch API.
- Minimal structure to focus purely on how request methods work.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This project is created to help beginners understand:

- How different HTTP request methods work.
- How to call APIs from front-end applications.
- How to send JSON data and read API responses.
- Basic error handling using JavaScript.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abishekkhanna/api-request-methods.git
cd api-request-methods

2. Open the index.html file in your browser.


3. Use the buttons/forms in the UI to trigger API requests.


4. Open your browser console to see logs, responses, or errors.


5. Edit script.js to point to your own API endpoints if needed.

✔ PUT Request

Used to update existing data.

✔ DELETE Request

Used to delete resources.

Each method is implemented using the JavaScript Fetch API.

📘 Learning Outcomes

How to make API calls from JavaScript.

How request methods differ.

How to read and send JSON.

How to debug API calls through browser dev tools.


🔧 How to Extend This Project

Connect the code to a real API endpoint.

Add authentication headers.

Show API response in the webpage instead of console.

Add input fields to dynamically modify request payloads.
